							<h1>A mobile app based on Artificial Intelligence using an Apple iPhone and Apple Watch aimed at alerting drivers to the early signs of driver fatigue.</h1>

							<p> Drive Aware is an iOS App supported by a WatchOS App for the Apple iPhone and Apple Watch
							that will allow motor vehicle drivers to observe and track their biometric vital signs to alert them
							of the onset of driver fatigue caused by long and sustained periods of driving. Drive Aware will gather
							and track information using the sensors which are inbuilt into the Apple Watch 6 (and later) as well
							as the Apple iPhone 11 (and later), the front facing camera of the iPhone will also be utilised to track
							a driver’s visual cues caused by driver fatigue. AI Technology will be incorporated which will enable
							Drive Aware to learn baseline biometric vital signs of the driver as well as their visual mannerisms
							to improve fatigue detection and help eliminate false alerts of driver fatigue.
							<h4>Similar and Related Technology</h4>
							<p> Waymo is a fully autonomous technology that is in full control of a motor vehicle (Waymo Driver, 2021).
							This technology does away with a driver completely and relies on new technology and AI components not
							previously used in recent years. Waymo is working towards having a fleet of self-driving vehicles that
							operate in a similar way that an Uber driver works. A user can organise a pickup location and like Uber
							set their destination. Waymo is also working on the development of self-driving trucks.
							In our project interview with Daniel Atanasovski, we discovered that they put a lot of effort into
							driver monitoring as when they are testing their vehicles, they have a person supervising the car and
							need to ensure that focus is maintained.
							<p> Tesla and Cadillac and Other Built in Driver Assistance Systems are arguably the perceived market
							leaders when it comes to driver assistance systems and self-driving cars1 (Cars with Autopilot in 2021 -
							AutoPilot Review, 2021). Both technologies always require active driver supervision (Cadillac, 2021)
							(Tesla, 2021) but unlike Drive Aware technology, these systems focus on the safety features and AI
							that are inbuilt into the car which enables the car to make certain driving decisions dependent
							on the situation, for example, avoidance procedures in the event of a vehicle accident as well
							as emergency braking. While driver assistance packages included in cars may also have the aim of
							preventing collisions caused by fatigue, the application will be designed to monitor the driver and
							alert them to signs of fatigue, before the point at which driver assistance technology would
							normally be implemented.
							<p> Seeing Machines has developed technology that can robustly, accurately and in real-time, measure
							a driver’s visual attention to their environment, assess their degree of drowsiness and ultimately detect
							if the driver has passed a threshold of risk (SeeingMachines, 2021). Seeing Machines technology is already
							being used in the transport industry as well as being an OEM solution to various car companies, with their
							visual based technology built in along with other advanced safety features (Seeing Machines Limited SEE DMS
							Available in 2021 Cadillac Escalade, 2021). The technology utilises a sensitive visual tracking system,
							but they do not appear to have incorporated any other sensors to provide tangible evidence of driver fatigue.
							Drive Aware will fill that gap by providing an all-round solution that encompasses monitoring from
							multiple sensors and most importantly, Drive Aware is a truly mobile system which the driver can take
							with them and use in any vehicle.
							<h4>Related Mobile Applications</h4>
							<p>BreathalEyes is an App that can assess a user in real time to determine if that person is under the
							influence of alcohol based off their eye movement (BreathalEyes Inc, 2021). Information about
							BreathalEyes seems to be outdated and limited. The most recent information found in regard to a
							valuation and seed funding is from 2014 (BreathalEyes Company Profile: Valuation & Investors | PitchBook, 2021).
							<p>Coffewake Place the App in your pocket or on your lap and you will receive a physical vibration to help you stay
							awake (‎Coffeewake - keep me awake!, 2021).
							<p>Drive Awake and Drowsy Driving Alert use your camera to detect if you seem sleepy by watching your eyes
							(‎Drive Awake, 2021) (Drowsy Driving Alert: Sleepy driver warning, 2021).
							<p><i>Discontinued Applications:</i> Awake Drowsiness Detector for Driving. This application requires you
							to press a reset button every few seconds based on how tired you feel.
							Stay Awake features a prerecorded voice operator that will ask you to repeat words as a way of keeping
							you alert (5 Apps That Will Help You Stay Awake on a Long Drive, 2021).
							<h4>Planned Features:</h4>
							<b>Apple iPhone:</b>
							<br>Drive Aware App - Used to analyse the information of which both the iOS and WatchOS collect during use.
							(Apple Developer Documentation, 2021) Information such as the biometric vital signs data will be stored
							through the mobile app on a cloud-based service. The mobile app will be used as the go-between software
							that incorporates the iPhone technology being used for the Drive Aware system, I.e., Accelerometer to measure a
							vehicles speed.</p>
							<p>Medical ID integration - Information already stored on the drivers iPhone will be used to notify emergency
							services and their emergency contact in the event of an accident or unresponsiveness.
							(Create and share your Medical ID in Health on iPhone, 2021) During the initial setup
							of a driver’s profile in the Drive Aware App, the driver will be asked to ensure this information is up to
							date.
							<p>GPS - In the event of a crash, the iPhones GPS can be used to help locate a driver that is unresponsive.
							(Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-q)
							<p>Accelerometer - Used to measure an iPhones speed. (Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-g) Based off the
							accelerometer readings, the Drive Aware App will send an alert to the driver if their speed becomes erratic.
							Erratic speed can be a sign on driver fatigue (Top 10 signs of driver fatigue, 2021). The accelerometer can
							also detect if the vehicle comes to an erupt stop. Contact will then be made to emergency services by the app.
							<p>Front Facing Camera - This camera will be used by the Drive Aware App to detect a driver’s visual fatigue
							cues. Changes in eye movement 2, yawning, rapid or slowed blinking and the inability to remain visually
							attentive are all visual cues of driver fatigue which the camera will be able to detect. (Apple Developer
							Documentation, 2021-c)
							<p>Stopwatch / Timer - An alert will advise the driver when a predetermined amount of driving time has been
							reached. (Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-j) This will be a cue for the driver to stop and take a rest.
							An additional “rest” timer will be used to advise the driver how long they have rested for. The timer will
							be calibrated with an algorithm that learns the time it usually takes an individual driver to become tired
							while accounting for the driver’s recent sleep patterns.
							<p>AI Technology - AI Technology will be used to first learn and then determine a driver’s visual fatigue
							cues, based off their eye movement, rate of blinking, yawning and overall alertness. (Machine Learning -
							Apple Developer, 2021)</p>
							<b>Apple Watch:</b>
							<br>Drive Aware App - Used to send majority of notifications to alert drivers of the fatigue cues.
							(Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-r)</p>
							<p>Heart Rate Monitor - The newly included heart rate sensor will be used to monitor a driver’s heart rate
							while driving. (Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-k) A higher or lower than normal heart rate can be an
							early sign of driver fatigue.
							<p>GPS - Similarly to the iPhone GPS, the watch GPS can help locate a driver that has become separated from
							their vehicle or their iPhone. (Use your Apple Watch without your iPhone nearby, 2021)
							<p>Accelerometer and Gyroscope - Information will be gathered that determines if a driver’s watch wearing
							arm is active, I.e., using the steering wheel. Alerts will be sent to the driver if the watch wearing arm
							has been inactive for too long 5. (Accelerometer and Gyroscope - Interaction - WatchOS - Human Interface
							Guidelines - Apple Developer, 2021)
							<p>Reaction Time Test - To help determine if a driver is capable of holding their attention after a rest
							period, a driver will be asked to complete a quick “game”. This game will ask the driver to tap on a colour
							when prompted for a total of three times. Should the driver fail at the game, the rest timer will restart,
							and the process will begin again 6.
							<h4>Motivation:</h4>
							<p>Humans make mistakes and a lot of our mistakes are small and inconsequential but some of our mistakes can
							have far reaching and devastating effects to not only ourselves but to our loved ones and to those who we
							don’t even know. Drive fatigue is one such mistake that has the potential to be far reaching and devastating
							by causing death and injury.
							<p>For the purposes of this project, fatigue can be taken to mean a state of reduced physical or mental
							alertness which impairs performance on a range of cognitive and psychomotor tasks including driving
							(Vogelpohl, Kühn, Hummel and Vollrath, 2019) and is considered to be the outcome of a self-regulative
							process of managing personal discomfort and tiredness (Fisher, Rizzo, Caird and Lee, 2011). Considering
							this, it is worth considering the process of falling asleep which is not sudden, rather a continuous,
							interwoven series of changes which begins with relaxed drowsiness, succession of intermediate states,
							part wakefulness and part sleep in varying proportions (Ogilvie, 2001). The problem that this causes when a
							human is responsible for the control of a motor vehicle is that there is no set point at which a person will
							know that they are “asleep at the wheel”.
							<p>Unfortunately, evidence points to drivers having little awareness of their own level of alertness
							(Fisher, Rizzo, Caird and Lee, 2011) and a study of thirty young, male drivers found 80 minutes to be the
							safe upper limit for monotonous highway driving (Ting, Hwang, Doong and Jeng, 2008). Alarmingly, this is
							40 minutes less than the suggested break interval of 2 hours made by the Department of Transport and Main
							Roads. (Driving tired (Department of Transport and Main Roads), 2021)
							<h5><a href="https://www.bitre.gov.au/statistics/safety"> Deaths per year on Australian Roads </a></h5>

							<li>94% of crashes involve human error or choice in the US</li>
							<p>(Waymo, 2021)</p>
							<p>By developing technology that can track, alert and educate a driver to the early signs of driver fatigue,
							the DATT hopes to reduce the number of deaths and injuries to drivers and road users.
							<h4>Description:</h4>
							<p>Drive Aware is an iOS App with WatchOS App which will gather and track a driver’s biometric vital signs and
							will alert them of early fatigue indictors caused by continuous periods of driving. The App does this by collecting
							data from the Apple iPhone App and the WatchOS App in conjunction with sensors that are inbuilt into the Apple
							iPhone and the Apple Watch. For the project’s initial development, it has been decided to work with the devices
							above only in the hope that it will simplify its development and introduce other platforms and devices over time.
							<p>On initial setup of the Drive Aware App, the driver will need to complete their Profile. Profile setup
							will ensure the driver has completed all the necessary steps to ensure the Drive Aware App runs effectively.
							Essential profile information includes completing the drivers details in the Health App which comes
							preinstalled on iPhones.
							<p>Information within the Health App includes, name, date of birth, sex, weight, height, blood type and a list
							of any medicine the driver is currently on and of which may affect heart rate. Medical ID information setup through
							the Health App will also include confirming the driver has an emergency contact listed.
							<p>The driver will be asked to give permissions to the Drive Aware App for iOS and WatchOS to access data
							about location settings to enable GPS within the App and ask for permissions in order to use the front facing
							camera due to the collection of data and recording of the driver while the App is in use. Drive Aware will
							automatically use the accelerometer, gyroscope and heart rate monitor data from the iPhone and Apple Watch
							with a notification advising of the permissions granted.
							<p>It is assumed that due to the nature of the Apple Watch, a driver’s baseline heart rate has already been
							recorded through the Heart Rate App, and as access has already been granted to retrieve this data; Drive
							Aware will automatically use this information and any information available on the user’s usual sleep
							patterns.
							<p>In car setup of your iPhone will be required to calibrate the front facing camera. A driver will be asked
							to mount their phone onto their vehicle’s dashboard or inner windscreen via a suitable phone mount that does
							not obstruct the cameras view. The choice of mount will be of the driver’s preference, and it will be highly
							recommended that the phone is connected to the in-vehicle power supply via cable.
							<p>Calibration of the visual monitoring system will take place the first time the Drive Aware App is used.
							The system will confirm with the driver that the iPhone has been placed in a suitable mount and a reminder
							will be given to connect their iPhone to a power supply.
							<p>Calibration will include the visual testing of the driver by asking them to perform a series of simple
							tasks. Tasks will include looking at the front facing camera, the driver will be prompted to blink a number
							of times, move their gaze up and down as well as left and right, and perform a simulation of yawning by
							opening and closing their mouth. AI Technology will then be able to use this calibrated information to
							further learn a driver’s visual mannerisms or cues every time they use Drive Aware and then be able to detect
							if the driver is experiencing driver fatigue.
      				<p>As the vehicle moves, the accelerometer in the iPhone will monitor the speed of the vehicle. If the speed
							of the vehicle is determined to be erratic (speed increases or decreases at an irregular pace) an alert will
							be shown across the iPhones screen, with the driver needing to dismiss the alert to stop any further action
							by the App. Should the driver fail to dismiss the initial alert, an alarm will be sounded to further get the
							drivers attention. Failing the dismissal of the second alert, the Drive Aware App will attempt to contact
							emergency services and the driver’s emergency contact. This action will also be used in the event the
							accelerometer detects a sudden decrease in speed which could be the result of a crash.
							<p>While the Drive Aware App is in use for both the iPhone and Apple Watch, the GPS will be set to always on.
							In the event of a crash, emergency service personnel will be able to use the GPS coordinates to help locate
							the driver should they be unresponsive. Having the ability to locate the driver sooner rather than later via
							GPS could be the difference between life and death.
							<p>Along with the accelerometer, a timer will automatically start when vehicle movement is detected through
							the iPhone. An alert will sound when two hours of continuous driving has been reached and the App will
							recommend the driver to stop the vehicle to have a rest. Once the vehicle has come to a complete stop the
							alert will disappear and a “rest” timer will begin a count down from fifteen minutes. The rest timer will not
							be able to be dismissed until the countdown has been completed. Upon completion of the rest time, a “game”
							will appear on the iPhones screen to measure the driver’s attention. When prompted, a driver will be asked to
							tap on a colour within a two second time frame. The driver will be asked a total of three times to tap on the
							required colour with each time being a different colour. Should the driver fail to tap the correct colour or
							fail to tap in the required timeframe on any turn, a second fifteen-minute rest timer will start, and the
							process of the game will be restarted.
							<p><b>Example of game colour palette</b></p>
							<img src="images/colour_game_palette.jpg" alt="colour_game_palette" width="500" height="320">
							<p>(Format, 2021)
							<p>The Drive Aware WatchOS App will monitor data from the heart rate sensor which is located on the bottom
							side of the watch face and pressed against the driver’s skin. As previously mentioned, a driver’s baseline
							heart rate will have already been collected. At a glance, the driver will be able to see their current heart
							rate as well as their baseline heart rate. The App will alert the driver should their heart rate either drop
							below or increase above their normal heart rate for a sustained amount of time. Should the driver be
							unresponsive and unable to dismiss the alert, emergency service personnel will be advised as well as the
							emergency contact.
							<p>The Apple Watch has a separate accelerometer and gyroscope to the iPhone. These two sensors will be used
							to measure the specific movements associated with using a steering wheel. Being able to monitor these
							movements, ensures the driver has their arm and hand in the required position at all times. Should the driver
							stop or drop their arm from being able to perform the actions associated with the steering wheel, an alert
							will remind them to reposition their arm into the correct position. The alert will need to be dismissed or
							failure to do so will result in an audible alarm sound. Again, should the alarm not be turned off and
							dismissed, emergency service personnel as well as the driver’s emergency contact will be advised of a
							possible crash event.
							<p>AI Technology will enhance the effectiveness of the Drive Aware System in real time. AI Technology will be
							used to help track and effectively identify the visual cues of driving related fatigue. The technology will
							be able to tell if a driver is distracted and not paying suitable attention to the road. Visual cues include
							eye movement or lack thereof, rate of blinking weather that be too fast or too slow, yawning and eye
							attentiveness. With the ability to continually learn, AI Technology will continue to improve and identify
							the visual cues at a much faster and accurate rate than previously possible.
							<p>All data that is collected and used by Drive Aware will be encrypted and stored using a Software as a
							Service cloud-based solution. Drive Aware will have a number of data center locations to choose from and
							should drivers ask, they will be given an option to choose a preferred data site location. Being able to
							offer this choice helps to build trust in the user base and provides extra assurances of data being managed
							correctly and ethically by the Drive Aware Tech Team.
							<h4>Plan. Implement. Deliver.</h4>
							<p>Moving into the next stage of Drive Aware from theoretical stage to tangible results towards a working
							prototype. Based off the work completed in Assessment Task Two, the Drive Aware Tech Team believes we can
							deliver artifacts such as a user interface design that will highlight the features of the Drive Aware App
							for both iOS and WatchOS.
							<li>UI design showcasing the layout of the IOS App.
							<li>UI design showcasing the layout of the WatchOS App
							<li>User profile, confirming user details have been completed in the Health App with Medical ID Information<p>
							<p>The target market for the project is primarily the individual user of the application but it is
							conceivable that motoring organisations, insurers or rental car companies among others may be interested
							in purchasing in bulk and offering the application to their customers or members.
							<img src="images/drive_aware_diagram.jpg" width="600" height="420">
							<h4>Tools & Technology:</h4>
							<p>The following tools and tech will be required in order to complete the design and implementation
							of the Drive Aware App.
							<li>iMac or MacBook - Used as the Software Developers interface to design and code the App.
      				<li>iPhone - Used to test the functionality of the App during the testing phase.
      				<li>Apple Watch - Used to test the functionality of the App during the testing phase.
							<p><p><b>Apple Developer Technologies:</b>
							<p><b>SwiftUI</b> provides views, controls, and layout structures for declaring your app’s user interface.
							The framework provides event handlers for delivering taps, gestures, and other types of input to your app,
							and tools to manage the flow of data from your app’s models down to the views and controls that users will
							see and interact with (Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-n).
							<p>Use <b>Create ML</b> with familiar tools like Swift and macOS playgrounds to create and train custom machine
							learning models on your Mac. You can train models to perform tasks like recognizing images, extracting
							meaning from text, or finding relationships between numerical values (Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-n).
							<p><b>Core Motion</b> reports motion- and environment-related data from the onboard hardware of iOS devices,
							including from the accelerometers and gyroscopes, and from the pedometer, magnetometer, and barometer. You use this
							framework to access hardware-generated data so that you can use it in your app. For example, a game might use
							accelerometer and gyroscope data to control onscreen game behaviour (Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-i).
							<p><b>Core Location</b> provides services that determine a device’s geographic location, altitude, and
							orientation, or its position relative to a nearby iBeacon device. The framework gathers data using all
							available components on the device, including the Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, magnetometer, barometer, and cellular
							hardware (Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-d).
							<p><b>User-facing notifications</b> communicate important information to users of your app, regardless of whether
							your app is running on the user's device (Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-e).
							<p>The <b>PushKit</b> framework supports specialized notifications for updating your WatchOS complications,
							responding to file provider changes, and receiving incoming Voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls. PushKit notifications differ
							from the ones you handle with the User Notifications framework. Instead of displaying an alert, badging your app’s
							icon, or playing a sound, PushKit notifications wake up or launch your app and give it time to respond. Both PushKit
							and User Notifications use the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) to deliver push notifications to user devices
							(Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-q).
							<p>As the system gathers information using various sensors on a device, <b>SensorKit</b> enables an app to access select
							raw data, or metrics that the system processes from a sensor (Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-l).
							<p>The <b>System Configuration</b> framework provides functions that determine the reachability of target hosts in both a
							synchronous and an asynchronous manner. It also provides error detection facilities (Apple Developer Documentation,
							2021-m).
							<p>Use the <b>Watch Connectivity</b> framework to transfer data between your iOS app and the WatchKit extension of a
							paired WatchOS app (Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-p).
							<p>The <b>WatchKit</b> framework provides the infrastructure for creating WatchOS apps, including an extension
							delegate that manages background tasks, extended runtime sessions, Siri intents, and workout sessions
							(Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-r).
							<p>Use <b>Core ML</b> to integrate machine learning models into your app. Core ML provides a unified representation
							for all models. Your app uses Core ML APIs and user data to make predictions, and to train or fine-tune
							models, all on the user’s device (Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-s).
							<p><b>Swift</b> includes modern features like type inference, optionals, and closures, which make the syntax concise
							yet expressive. Swift ensures your code is fast and efficient, while its memory safety and native error
							handling make the language safe by design. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun in Swift Playgrounds,
							playgrounds in Xcode, and REPL (Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-f).
							<p><b>Xcode</b> consists of a suite of tools that developers use to build apps for Apple platforms. Use Xcode
							to manage your entire development workflow—from creating your app to testing, optimizing, and submitting it
							to the App Store (Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-n).
							<p><b>HealthKit</b> provides a central repository for health and fitness data on iPhone and Apple Watch. With
							the user’s permission, apps communicate with the HealthKit store to access and share this data
							(Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-u).
							<p>The <b>App Store Connect API</b> is a REST API that enables the automation of actions you take in App Store Connect
							(Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-k).
							<p>The <b>App Store</b> is a safe and trusted place for customers to discover apps, and a great opportunity for
							developers to deliver apps and services across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch in 175 regions
							(App Store - Apple Developer, 2021-b).
							<p><b>TestFlight</b> makes it easy to invite users to test your apps and app clip experiences and collect
							valuable feedback before releasing your apps on the App Store. You can invite up to 10,000 testers using just their
							email address or by sharing a public link (TestFlight - Apple Developer, 2021).
							<p><b>AVCam</b> allows the App to capture photos with depth data and record video using the front and rear iPhone cameras.
							(Apple Developer Documentation, 2021-b)
							<h4>Skills:</h4>
							<p>The skills required would come from someone with a background as a Software Developer, and more
							specifically an iOS Software Developer.
							<br>Their skill set would include.
							<li>A computer science or software engineering degree or equivalent experience
							<li>A deep understanding and experience with developing native iOS applications
							<li>A thorough understanding of Xcode, Swift and iOS framework
							<li>A knowledge of developing applications for the WatchOS
							<li>Being able to problem solve using logic and methodical testing processes
							<li>Developing testing and validation processes
							<li>Deploying code to the live environment
							<li>Experience with cloud-based software development
							<li>AWS experience would be a bonus
							<li>Machine learning and AI Technology experience
							<p>(How to become a Developer - Salary, Qualifications, skills & Reviews – SEEK, 2021),
							(Senior iOS Developer, 2021), (iOS Developer, 2021)
							<p>Due to the nature of the assignment, coupled with our teams limited skill set of a Software Developer. We as a team
							will be attempting to bring the Drive Aware App as close to our goal of tangible results towards a working
							prototype.
							<p>Our aim is to use our current skill sets and online tools (Udemy Tech Tutorials) in upskilling ourselves to give us the
							ability to deliver artifacts such as a user interface design that will highlight the features of the Drive Aware App
							for both iOS and WatchOS.
							<p>We believe the most useful skill we can acquire is to gain experience in learning how to use the Xcode platform as well
							as learning the programming code Swift.
							<h4>Future Tools & Technology:</h4>
							<p><b>EEG</b> - The measurements of an electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used to identify synchronisation of
							specific bands of signals from different cortical areas during the onset and development of fatigue with associated
							blood biochemistry markers - an increase in blood glucose and serum creatinine levels. (Kar, Routray and Nayak, 2011)
							In other words, defined patterns in the electrical activity of the brain which change as it moves towards a state of
							sleep. As things stand, measurement of brain waves while driving is beyond the scope of this project but there have
							been considerable developments in the portability of the technology involved, for example the development of a
							headband EEG. (Berger, 2021) We believe that as this technology evolves and portability issues improve, an EEG
							headband could be used in conjunction with the Drive Aware App. Although this would require the App user to
							purchase additional hardware, it would likely improve the efficacy of the service and there are manufactures of such
							headsets that are currently looking for developers to create applications for their products.(BrainBit, 2021) (
							SenzeBand: The Brainwave Sensor for Everyone | Neeuro, 2021). However, we still believe that the maintenance of the
							initial version of using an iPhone and Apple Watch should be maintained to maximise the potential market for its
							use.
							<p><b>Thermal Imaging</b> - Research completed by (Kiashari et al., 2020) provides evidence that their new
							non-intrusive driver drowsiness detection method can detect drowsiness by reviewing a driver’s respiration
							analysis via facial thermal imaging. Their results have shown they can accurately detect drowsiness levels to
							an accuracy of 90%, sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 85%, and precision of 91%. (Kiashari et al., 2020) By
							incorporating a thermal imaging framework into the Drive Aware App, it could potentially provide an
							additional information stream to alert the driver of the signs of fatigue.
							<p><b>Audio and Visual System Integration</b> - Following our interview with Daniel Atanasovski,(Josevski,
							2021) he question around integrating Drive Aware with the on-board navigation system of a vehicle came up.
							That question led to the thinking on the ability of integrating the Drive Aware App with the audio and
							visual system of a vehicle by allowing the interface of the App to be shown on the in-built digital screen.
							By enabling this integration as part of the Drive Aware App, it would mean the driver’s attention would be
							more focussed on the act of driving and any notifications that would have previously come through the iPhone
							would now be centrally located with all other alerts that the vehicle would use through the audio and visual
							system.
							<p><b>Road Safety Innovation Fund (Australia)</b> - The Road Safety Innovation Fund (Office of Road Safety)
							targets innovative projects designed to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on Australian roads.
							(Australian Government Office of Road Safety, 2021) The program itself is run by the Australian Government
							and provides funding to suitable projects that contribute to a safe and sustainable road transport system
							toward Vision Zero - zero fatal and serious injuries on our road by 2050. (Programs, 2021). It is hoped by
							applying and gaining funding, the Drive Aware App will be able to be developed to it’s full potential and
							include not only the outlined Future Tools and Technology but other innovations that are identified through
							it’s life cycle.
							<h4>Conclusion</h4>
							<p>A single life being saved because of the development of this application would make it worthwhile.
							While other technologies exist that serve the purpose that Drive Aware aims to fulfil, there are
							significant differences in the way in which they function and limits on their portability between vehicles
							meaning that this service would provide a useful alternative or could be useful to supplement them.
							Furthermore, the uptake of these technologies indicates that there may well be appetite in the market for
							similar products, be that from individuals or organisations wishing to promote safe driving such as insurers
							or rental car companies. There is further merit in the Drive Aware App as a cost-effective solution to other
							available technologies that are typically priced out of the reach of the average user, I.e., middle class
							families, young drivers, and students. While most people today have access to a smart phone and the uptake in
							wearable technology is steadily growing, which again makes the Drive Aware App more feasible to a wider
							market.
							<p>While initial development of the application would require little in the way of equipment, it is
							recognised that completing this process is beyond the current skill set of our group. However, we will
							endeavour to take this project from its theoretical stage to as close as possible to a working prototype.

							    <li>2. The application will aim to make use of changes in eye movement.  Slow Eye Movement (SEM) – these movements are known to commence in drowsy wakefulness and continue through the stages of fatigue and into stage 1 sleep.  They are most frequent in the minute prior to episodes of sleep and tend to disappear as sleep is entered.  Researchers have claimed that monitoring drivers with cameras programmed with a SEM detection algorithm will prevent sleep related accidents (SHIN, SAKAI and UCHIYAMA, 2010). While it isn’t clear that this is achievable with the front facing camera on a smartphone being positioned to face the driver, the application will attempt to determine whether changes in eye movement are an indication of fatigue</li>
							    <li>3. The development, onset and severity of fatigue varies considerably among individuals but all of us are more likely to experience it when driving at times that disturb our circadian rhythm (Fisher, Rizzo, Caird and Lee, 2011).  Because of this, the app should if possible factor in a driver’s likely decreased performance when they have either had less sleep or are driving at a time where they would normally be asleep.</li>
							    <li>4. Heart rate has been observed to decrease gradually at the onset of sleep with a notable drop-in rate around 30 seconds before the onset of both stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  A decrease in oxygenated haemoglobin can also be observed after stage one sleep but this is sudden and short lived (Ogilvie, 2001).</li>
							    <li>5. Actigraphy is the measurement of wrist and associated body movement. Both are more dramatic and continuous when awake than when asleep. Actigraphy represents a convenient and portable method of measuring states of sleep but it does lack precision as measurements tend to underestimate the onset of sleep. (Ogilvie, 2001) By the time a change has been recorded a measurement it may be too late.  A study comparing four wrist worn devices to polysomnography, the ‘gold standard’ for sleep measurement but not something that can be practically done while driving, found that while devices could be shown to be accurate considering their cost.  However, there was some variance both among actigraphs and in their comparison to polysomnography (Mantua, Gravel and Spencer, 2016).</li>
							    <li>6.  There is evidence that suggests that playing video games up to a certain amount of time has an increase in alertness, cognitive skills and an increase in visual selective activities. (One Hour of Video Gaming Can Increase the Brain's Ability to Focus, 2021)
